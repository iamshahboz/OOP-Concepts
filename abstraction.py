# Abstraction isn't supported directly in Python. 
# Calling a magic method, on the other hand, allows for abstraction.
# If an abstract method is declared in a superclass, subclasses that inherit from the superclass must have their own implementation of the method.
# A superclass's abstract method will never be called by its subclasses. 
# But the abstraction aids in the maintenance of a similar structure across all subclasses.

# Code. Coming soon...
